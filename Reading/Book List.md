| American Born Chinese         | Yang, Gene Luen      | 11/18            | Delivered a unique message through weaving together three storylines. Very fitting coming of age story. |
| The Awakening                 | Chopin, Kate         | 2/18             |                                                              |
| The Bluest Eye                | Morrison, Toni       | 5/18             |                                                              |
| The Complete Maus             | Spiegelman, Art      | 9/18; 4/19; 5/20 | All time favorite novel. A brilliant and heart-wrenching piece that I found so moving. Spiegelman's framing is so well thought out, and the story is incredibly powerful events of the Holocaust augmented by the striking symbolism. |
| Frankenstein                  | Shelley, Mary        | 10/17; 9/20      | Framing structure impresses me everytime. Suspenseful and more thought-provoking than frightening. Encapsulates Romanticism and women's rights, and allows space for the reader to interpret. |
| Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic | Bechdel, Alison      | 12/18            | Unapologetic graphic memoir. Distinct imagery; at times uncomfortable, but a very raw read. |
| The Great Gatsby              | Fitzgerald, F. Scott | 3/18             |                                                              |
| The Scarlet Letter            | Hawthorne, Nathaniel | 2/18             | Verbose but eloquent. Pervasive symbolism.                   |
