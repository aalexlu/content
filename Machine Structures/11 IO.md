# I/O

*I/O interface for interacting with outside world (keyboards, network, mouse, display)*

## Polling & Interrupts

Polling and interrupts relevant to not only low level programming

| Operation                      | Definition                                                   | +                                                            | -                                                            |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Polling                        | Keep checking if data is ready to be used; *while* (! is_ready read_data()); control register bit (0→1) | low latency, low overhead; good for devices that give you a constant stream of data (e.g. reading a sensor) | *while* loop is wasteful if there's no data; prevents other processes from making progress |
| Interrupts *(mouse, keyboard)* | OS produces "exception" when hardware is ready. When ready, OS runs "interrupt handler" to process data (like *JavaEventListener* or JavaScript callback) | can do useful work while waiting for response; easy to wait on multiple different events at once; good for devices that respond infrequently | interrupts can occur unpredictably; high overhead due to context switch to OS; higher latency, worse throughput |

in practice, we mix the two!

- ex: set interrupt to wait for network connection to be ready, begin polling after we begin getting data

#### % Processor Time to Poll Mouse

- **Polling** → 30 [polls/s] * 400 [clocks/poll] = 12*10^3^ [clocks/s]
- **% Processor** → 12* 10^3^ [clocks/s] / 1*10^9^ [clocks/s] = 0.0012%

## Memory Mapped I/O

Works with both polling and interrupt driven I/O

| Address    | I/O Device          |      |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ---- |
| 0xFFFF0000 | Receiver Control    |      |
| 0xFFFF0004 | Receiver Data       |      |
| 0xFFFF0008 | Transmitter Control |      |
| 0xFFFF000C | Transmitter Data    |      |

``````
Pseudocode:
read receiver control
- if receiver control != 1: loop back
- read receiver data
read transmitter control
- if transmitter control != 1: loop back
- while to transmitter data
``````

``````
									lui t0, 0xffff0		// t0 = 0xffff0000
receive wait:			lw t1, 0(t0)
									andi t1, t1, 1
									beq t1,x 0, receive_wait
									lb t2, 4(t0)			// loads receiver data byte
transmitter_wait: lw t1, 8(t0)
									andi t1, t1, 1
									beq t1, x0, transmitter_wait
									sb t2, 12(t0)
``````

## DMA

*allows I/O devices to directly read/write main memory*
