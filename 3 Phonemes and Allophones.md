# Phonemes and Allophones

## 1 Phones

**morphemes:** smaller but still meaningful units  
**phones** (segments): - even smaller units  
**combinatoriality:** small number of meaningless sounds can be rearranged to create large vocabularies characteristic of human languages  

- great range of possibilities but *no means altogether free*
## 2 Sound Patterns

phonological grammar: knowledge of sound patterns constitutes  

## 3 Contrast and Phonematicity

some phone variation matters while others do not  

## 3.1 Distributional Patterns

**free variation:** one phone can be substituted for another without consequence (same env)  

- ex: [tʰɪp] ~ [tʰɪp̚] - ‘tip’  

**complementary:** phones occur in mutually exclusive environments  

- ex: [pʰæk] and [kʰæp]  
    - [pʰ] voiceless aspirated bilabial stop found word-initially  
    - [p] unaspirated voiceless bilabial stop found word-finally, before unstressed vowels or consonants  

**contrast:** phones occur equally well in the same env, but choice conveys a difference in meaning  

- ex: [pʰɛt] ‘pet’ and [bɛt] ‘bet’  
## 3.2 Phonemes and Allophones

distinct phonemes: contrasting phones  
**phoneme:** multiple pronunciation variants

- contrast with one another

**allophone:** pronunciation variant of a phoneme  

- predictable

Underlying Representation: phonemic level  
Surface Representation: phonetic level  

## 3.3 Determining Phonemic Affiliations

**minimal pairs:** pair of words with distinct meanings that differ by one phone
near minimal pairs  
conditioning environment: results in the choice of one phone over the other  

## 3.4 Conditions on Conditioning

**locality:** conditioning environments should be local  
**naturalness:** should “make sense” phonetically  

- allophones of a single phoneme should be phonetically similar  
## 4 Contrast and Neutralization

**neutralization:** potential for contrast between two phones may be suspended - only one is possible  

- ex: English flapping  
## 5 Rules

Since allophones are predictable, we can write rules to predict the allophone of a given phoneme based on the environment of that phoneme  
Format:

        /Phoneme/ → [allophone] / environment  
                [allophone] / elsewhere
