Building models that can tell us things in NLP

## Language Model
- Language models provide us with a way to quantify the likelihood of a sequence — i.e., plausible sentences.
- Vocabulary *V* is a finite set of discrete sybols (words, characters); V = | *V* |
- *V+* is the infinite set of sequences of symbols from *V*; each sequence ends with STOP
- x ∈ *V+* (a given sentence)
- P(w) = P(w1, …, wn)
	- P("Call me Ishmail") = P(w1 = “call”, w2 = “me”, w3 = “Ishmael”) x P(STOP)

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) – picture of text, what do the characters / pixels look like
Machine translation
- fidelity (to source text) how much meaning from the English is in the Italian
- fluency (of the translation)
Autocomplete is language modeling
