## What makes language hard?

- language is a complex social process
- tremendous ambiguity at every level of representation
- modeling it is AI-complete (requires first solving AI)

Speech acts ("can you pass the salt?")
- statement that does not elicit a response
Conversational implicature ("The opera singer was amazing; she sang all of the notes.")
- describes the bare minimum; implies not that good
- ChatGPT doesn't understand the conversational implicature
Shared knowledge ("Warren ran for president")
- depends on context such as when this was said
Variation/Indexicality ("This homework is wicked hard")

Most difficult aspects to solve:
- Ambiguity ("One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas")
	- due to syntax
	- "shot" could refer to gun, camera, basketball

processing as representation
- NLP generally involves representing language for some end, whether dialogue, translation, speech recognition, or text analysis
