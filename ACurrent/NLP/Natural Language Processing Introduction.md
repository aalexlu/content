## What makes language hard?

- language is a complex social process
- tremendous ambiguity at every level of representation
- modeling it is AI-complete (requires first solving AI)

Speech acts ("can you pass the salt?")
- statement that does not elicit a response
Conversational implicature ("The opera singer was amazing; she sang all of the notes.")
- describes the bare minimum; implies not that good
- ChatGPT doesn't understand the conversational implicature
Shared knowledge ("Warren ran for president")
