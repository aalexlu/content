#### Non-linear Function
-   Function: takes a number & perform mathematical operation
-   Common Types of Non-linearity (pros and cons for each on website)
    -   ReLUs (Rectified Linear Units)
    -   Sigmoid
    -   Tanh

	- Hidden layer

#### Self-attention
- simplest form of self-attention: scaled dot-product self-attention
	- query, key, and value vectors role in attending to the input sequence
