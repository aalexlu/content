## Development
Growth, Natural (plants, people), Trajectory (upwards), Inevitable
**"development discourse"**
- discourse: ways of constituting knowledge and talking about them–usually involving power dynamics
- Escobar defines it as "the process of articulating knowledge and power through which particular concpets, theories, and practices for social change are created and reproduced"
- egrarian -> industrial
	- implies evolution or improvement rather than a neutral perspective
- UNDP recruitment video

Development includes conversations of history and power
- remnants of post-WWII legacies
- Soviet history in the context of the Ukraine War
Development not as purely economic
- political and social
- just as cultural and identity driven
Globalization provides the context for development
- we are talking about countries engaged with one another for the sake of development/progress/modernization

# 2 What is Development?

*January 19, 2023*

## What is development?
Amartya Sen, nobel prize winning economist
- "A process of expanding the real freedoms that people enjoy"
	- We don't just expand for progress sake
- What is the point of $
	- Expand your freedoms
	- About capabilities

## Development as Freedom
1. Political freedoms  
2. Economic facilities  
3. Social opportunities (land rights)
4. Transparency guarantees (ethics)
5. Protective security (retirement fund, employment fund)

- Increasing freedoms -> large capability sets
- Goal of development: increase all capabilities
	- what is development? how should we get there?
- Freedom as both ends (the goal) AND means
- 2 roles: evaluation and effectiveness
- Ex: free markets
- Opposes slavery or government control
	- allows for high degree of freedom
	- got there through unfreedoms
- Markets provide immediate increase in economic freedom (freedom as an end)
	- evaluative role of freedom
- but does it also serve as a means to increasing freedom (freedom as a means)
	- effectiveness role of freedom
- Development involves increasing freedoms both as means and ends
	- Evaluating development in terms of how many freedoms one has
	- Also evaluating in terms of whether the means of development promotes freedom
- Also involves eliminating sources of unfreedom (e.g. poverty)

## Problems with trying to define development this way
- The framework’s unit of analysis is the individual (or maybe household)
	- Might be comfortable for economic theorist
	- But how does this work for a political scientist? Political economist? Sociologist? 
- What if freedoms conflict?? Between households? Ethnic groups?
	- Example: US COVID, mask wearing/vaccines
	1. Often times, short term vs. long term
	2. Different groups of people (who benefits)
		- Ethnic or racial divides
		- Inequality and poverty (social class)
		- Global implications (e.g. environmental concerns)
	3. Differences in values
		- Valuing some freedom over others
		- Tradition vs. modernization
