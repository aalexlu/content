## Development
Growth, Natural (plants, people), Trajectory (upwards), Inevitable
**"development discourse"**
- discourse: ways of constituting knowledge and talking about them–usually involving power dynamics
- Escobar defines it as "the process of articulating knowledge and power through which particular concpets, theories, and practices for social change are created and reproduced"
- egrarian -> industrial
	- implies evolution or improvement rather than a neutral perspective
- UNDP recruitment video

Development includes conversations of history and power
- remnants of post-WWII legacies
- Soviet history in the context of the Ukraine War
Development not as purely economic
- political and social
- just as cultural and identity driven
Globalization provides the context for development
- we are talking about countries engaged with one another for the sake of development/progress/modernization

# 2 What is Development?

*January 19, 2023*

## What is development?
Amartya Sen, nobel prize winning economist
- "A process of expanding the real freedoms that people enjoy"
	- We don't just expand for progress sake
- What is the point of $
	- Expand your freedoms
	- About capabilities

## Development as Freedom
1. Political freedoms  
2. Economic facilities  
3. Social opportunities (land rights)
4. Transparency guarantees (ethics)
5. Protective security (retirement fund, employment fund)

- Increasing freedoms -> large capability sets
- Goal of development: increase all capabilities
	- what is development? how should we get there?
- Freedom as both ends (the goal) AND means
- 2 roles: evaluation and effectiveness
- Ex: free markets
- Opposes slavery or government control
	- allows for high degree of freedom
	- got there through unfreedoms
- Markets provide immediate increase in economic freedom (freedom as an end)
	- evaluative role of freedom
- but does it also serve as a means to increasing freedom (freedom as a means)
	- effectiveness role of freedom
- Development involves increasing freedoms both as means and ends
	- Evaluating development in terms of how many freedoms one has
	- Also evaluating in terms of whether the means of development promotes freedom
- Also involves eliminating sources of unfreedom (e.g. poverty)

## Problems with trying to define development this way
- The framework’s unit of analysis is the individual (or maybe household)
	- Might be comfortable for economic theorist
	- But how does this work for a political scientist? Political economist? Sociologist? 
- The problem of conficting freedoms
	- Example: US COVID, mask wearing/vaccines
	1. Often times, short term vs. long term
	2. Different groups of people (who benefits)
		- Ethnic or racial divides
		- Inequality and poverty (social class)
		- Global implications (e.g. environmental concerns)
	3. Differences in values
		- Valuing some freedom over others
		- Tradition vs. modernization
## Sen's solution
- democracy and self-determination (aka social choice)
- Ideally, democracy allows deliberation and debate -> society chooses for itself
- Ultimately, individual capabilities depend on collective capabilities!
	- What you want to value has to be also valued from the collective
	- This means CULTURE/RACE matters too!
		- Economists don’t like to think about how people develop their preferences E.g. utility maximization, but how much utility is gained from something?
		- On individual level, this isn’t a problem (you just choose what you want), but on collective level this IS a problem!
		- The result: your capability set may depend on what everyone else wants


## Summary of different dimensions/aspects of development
1.   As progress (stages with tangible results)  
2. As discourse (power and underlying values)  
3. As freedom (capabilities of individuals/collective)

## Why develop?
- Why do most countries choose the traditional route of development?
	- Industrialization and capitalism
	- Big economies, connected to the world (requiring a military and foreign relations)
	- Democratic government
- If you can be the happiest country without all these things, why such convergence?
- Remember, development is a discourse, which means it has a power dynamic
- Globalization of culture spreads in a top-down way
	- Ex: McDonalds, Hollywood, West becomes standards of development
- Comparison breeds jealousy which breeds dissatisfaction
	- Evans suggests this (comparison/culture)
