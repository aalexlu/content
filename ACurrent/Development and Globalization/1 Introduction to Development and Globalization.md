## Development
Growth, Natural (plants, people), Trajectory (upwards), Inevitable
**"development discourse"**
- discourse: ways of constituting knowledge and talking about themâ€“usually involving power dynamics
- Escobar defines it as "the process of articulating knowledge and power through which particular concpets, theories, and practices for social change are created and reproduced"
- egrarian -> industrial
	- implies evolution or improvement rather than a neutral perspective
- UNDP recruitment video

Development includes conversations of history and power
- remnants of post-WWII legacies
- Soviet history in the context of the Ukraine War
Development not as purely economic
- political and social
- just as cultural and identity driven
Globalization provides the context for development
- we are talking about countries engaged with one another for the sake of development/progress/modernization

## What is development?
Amartya Sen, nobel prize winning economist
- "A process of expanding the real freedoms that people enjoy"
	- We don't just expand for progress sake
- What is the point of $
	- Expand your freedoms
	- About capabilities

## Development as freedoms
1. Political freedoms  
2. Economic facilities  
3. Social opportunities  
4. Transparency guarantees  
5. Protective security
- Increasing freedoms -> large capability sets
- Goal of development: increase all capabilities
- Freedom as both ends AND means
- 2 roles: evaluation and effectiveness
