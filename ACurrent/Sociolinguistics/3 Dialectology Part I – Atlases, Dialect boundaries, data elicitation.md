## Core Ideas / Roadmap
Methods in dialectology: *traditional* and *computational*  
- Core concepts in dialectology
- Dialect atlases: motivation & data collection methods
- Mapping dialects & types of dialect boundaries
- Dialectology in the 21st century
- Perceptual dialectology  
Objective: to understand how dialectology is used to identify the factors that influence language change (esp. regional, but also ethnic)
- Dialectology as a precursor to contemporary sociolinguistic analysis (“urban dialectology”)

Attendance: I can tell if somebody is from California just from speaking with them.
Phonological: CVS - California Vowel Shift
Lexical: Like, hella
Shibboleth: distinguishes someone

## From Thursday:  [[2 Language and Varieties, Standard and Nonstandard]]
William Labov on where standard English comes from
1. SLI
2. Variable: 
	1. r-less speaker – car, storm, share, fear (come after a vowel)
Where do people speak correct English? perception of Southern Indiana undergrads
- Southerners deemed as speaking incorrect English
- largest stdev in New York
Important to establish standards because
- disseminating information 
- prevent miscommunications

## Core Concepts in Dialectology
Dialectology: dialect geogrophy
- the study of region patterning of linguistic variation
- *Linguistic* not just phonological or phonetic
	- accent but also broader

Dialectology across domains
- soda / pop / coke / other
- NEW Haven / new HAVEN (native) / interchangeable / other (phonological bc of stress)
- all same (merger: phonemes have merged) / marry = mary ≠ merry / all different

Methodology
- NORMs (Chambers & Trudgill 1998)
	- Ideal subjects for dialectology
	- **N**onmobile, **O**lder, **R**ural, **M**ale (less likely to be contaminated, not affected by 'innovations', women leaders of language change)

## Dialectological Research
*Deutscher Sprachatlas*
- postal questionnaires – Wenker's technique to collect data
- What are some of the problems?
	- response bias – who responds
	- bias toward standard
Why dialectological research?
- language change
- why there are boundaries
- breakdown in communication -> historical value (migration of populations, settlement patterns)

## Major US Dialect Atlases
- Linguistic Atlas of the United States and Canada (LAUSC)
- Dictionary of American Regional English (DARE)
	- 80 fieldworkers (grad students); 2,777 people in 1,002 communities
	- primarily lexical data
- The Atlas of North American English (ANAE)
	-  most influential in sociolinguistics
	- focus on phonological change and vowel chain shifts

Elicitation of regional forms
- prompt them to say a word without influencing them by saying it yourself
	- play recordings for people and ask them to categorize
- Weather: When it’s raining very heavily, you say, “It’s raining ________.”
- Money: If you buy something for much less than it usually costs, you say, “At ten dollars it was a what!”
- The past tense of *creep*
