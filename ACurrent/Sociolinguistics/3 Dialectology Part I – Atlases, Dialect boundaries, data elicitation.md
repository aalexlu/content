## Core Concepts in Dialectology

Dialectology: dialect geogrophy
- the study of region patterning of linguistic variation
- *Linguistic* not just phonological or phonetic
	- accent but also broader

Dialectology across domains
- soda / pop / coke / other
- NEW Haven / new HAVEN (native) / interchangeable / other (phonological bc of stress)
- all same / marry = mary ≠ merry / all different

Methodology
- NORMs (Chambers & Trudgill 1998)
	- Ideal subjects for dialectology
	- **N**onmobile, **O**lder, **R**ural, **M**ale (less likely to be contaminated, not affected by 'innovations', women leaders of language change)
- 
*Deutscher Sprachatlas*
- postal questionnaires – Wenker's technique to collect data
- What are some of the problems?
	- response bias – who responds
	- bias toward standard
-
