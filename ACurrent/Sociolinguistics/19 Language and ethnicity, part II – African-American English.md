## African-American English (AAE)
- Most studied language variety in sociolinguistics
- Takeways
	- AAE is a well-defined system with systematic linguistic rules
		- Distinctive features
	- Theories of the origins of AAE
	- Issues related to AAE and society
		- AAE in education, discrimination

#### From *Talking Black in America*
- Leave out *to be* after he, she
- Or John *be* studying
- AAE is rule-governed and systematic, not random

#### Not a "monolithic" variety
AAE is spoken by millions of people in communities around the US – lots of diveristy and variation in it

#### Vocabulary of AAE
- Distinctive vocab is not just "slang" (informal language currently used by young people)

#### Aspectual marking in AAE
- Invariant Habitual *be*, indicating a recurring activity or state
	- *Sometimes they be sitting in the library*, *Johnny be in class*
	- Ridiculed as "incorrect" since the form isn't conjugated, but *He be in class* not equal *He (is) in class*
- Stressed BIN, indicating an event occurred in the remote past (or has been occuring since the remote past)
	- *They BIN sitting in the conference room*, *I BIN got that part*
- Perfective *done* (not stressed), indicates a completed activity whose resultant state holds now
	- *Now I done give you everything I got to give you*
- None of these elements can be directly negated

#### Syntax of AAE
- Negative concord (didn't + nobody)
- Negative inversion (negative auxiliary precedes negative subject)
- Habitual *be* ('usually')
- Embedded inversion (of indirect questions)
	- SAE uses "if/whether" + declarative order, while AAE can have inversion embedded

#### Phonology of AAE
- Consonant cluster reduction at the end of words
	- [pt] kep(t), [kt] ac(t), [sk] (mas) mask, [ft], [ld], [nd]
	- Word-medially:
		- If cluster appears at the end of a root, and suffix starts iwth a consonant, there is usually reduction
		- *kin(d)ness*
		- Not if suffix starts with a vowel *acceptable*
- *Th*-stopping and *th*-fronting
	- *Dese* for these, *wit* for with
	- *Bir[f]day* for birthday, *smoo[v]* for smooth
	- Rules sensitive to word position

#### Intonational contours
- "sounding black"
- rental

## Origins of AAE
- To what extent is AAE historically related to English, African languages, or creoles?
- History of slavery in the (colonial) US
	- 1619 Africans enslaved
	- Caribbean islands, Africans vast majoriaty of population
	- **Pidgin**: medium of communication that emerges when speakers of different languages need to speak
	- **Creole**: acquired natively by children and expanded as a full language
	- Slaves learned English from other slaves
- Dominant theories
	- Linguistic origins
		- **Africanist/Afrocentrist/substratist view**: AAE is structurally similar to West African languages spoken by slaves brought to the colonies
		- **Creolist view**: AAE related to Jamaican Creole, Gullah, other creole languages
		- **Anglicist/dialectologist view**: AAE most similar to English dialects, with less clear or significant influences from African languages
	- Social origins (against a strictly "creolist" hypothesis)
		- **Founder principle view**: The variety emerged as Africans tried to acquire local patterns of English
		- **Settle principle view**: Africans created this variety, but it was never a creole, continued contact with creoles had influence
- Sources of evidence
	- Info on population sizes and movement of people
	- Speech examples from ex-slaves
	- Comparisons of current AAE w/ West African languages, Caribbean creoles, or white nonstandard varieties
	- Evidence from African-American diaspora

## Influences on AAE
- In vocab, it is overwhelmingly similar to English, not African or creole lexical items
- Evidence of African influence on phonology? *Th*-fronting/stopping and consonant cluster reduction
- Mixed evidence in grammatical features – Existential *it*, inverted word order
- Similarities with other creoles – Deletion of voiced stops *b, d, g* in preverbal tense markers, etc.
- Stronger evidence for creolist hypothesis? **Zero copula** (He ∅ happy)
	- No basis in British dialects
	- West African uses different copulas
	- 

## Continued development of AAE
- After Great Migration characterized by *divergence* from white varieties
- Increased segregation in housing
#### AAE in Oakland schools
- "Ebonics" was the *language* that African-American students spoke at home
- **Contrastive analysis** for dialect speakers – taught differences from standard English for reading gain
	- move them toward Standard english without devaluing their language
- Public response – people do not accept it as a different language, but as "bad English"
