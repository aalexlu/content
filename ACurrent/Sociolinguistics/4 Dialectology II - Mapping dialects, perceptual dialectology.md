Written dialect surveys
- pro: a lot of data at once
- con: range of variants may change, who is likely to respond to NYT

## Mapping Dialects
- pail vs bucket
	- large shapes represent communities (>4)
**Isoglosses**: geographic boundaries that separate two areas that differ along a specific language feature
- Dialect boundary: sharp (from US to Windsor, Canada) vs fading (cot, caught merger)
- Criticisms of isoglass bundles as map boundaries
	1. Fading and null boundaries are very common – unrealistic sharpness of what is actually gradient
	2. Isogloss placement can be subjective
	3. Might not reflect differences in how speakers self-identify regionally
	- Still can reveal a lot
