## Dialectology Overview

- Dialec

Written dialect surveys
- pro: a lot of data at once
- con: range of variants may change, who is likely to respond to NYT

## Mapping Dialects
- pail vs bucket
	- large shapes represent communities (>4)
**Isoglosses**: geographic boundaries that separate two areas that differ along a specific language feature
- Dialect boundary: sharp (from US to Windsor, Canada) vs fading (cot, caught merger)
- Criticisms of isoglass bundles as map boundaries
	1. Fading and null boundaries are very common – unrealistic sharpness of what is actually gradient
	2. Isogloss placement can be subjective
	3. Might not reflect differences in how speakers self-identify regionally
	- Still can reveal a lot
- Non-linguistic correlates of isoglosses: never a linguistic reason; usually because of communication between communities
	- correlation between the way communities speak but also maybe cultural things

21st century dialectology – statistical models to detect regional hotspots

## "Big data" in dialectology
- 'fixing to' vs 'finna'
- shift west and shift north of the green areas vs purple
- 

## Recap
Dialectology as dialect geography
- Documentation of regional differences
- Regional diffusion of variants, may indicate pathways of language change  
Methods of distinguishing and drawing dialect boundaries
- Isoglosses
- Correlates of isoglosses? (Rivers, borders, etc.)  
Dialects exist because we talk like the people we talk to


## Perceptual dialectology
- or folk dialectology
- non-linguists' perceptions of regional dialect variation
	- ex: asking "Where do they speak the most correct English?"
		- Michigan respondents: most identified the South, then NYC – linguistic security
		- Alabama respondents: linguistic insecurity but associates the dialect with pleasantness

in CA
- a perceptual study of a single state, by its own residents
- stereotypes about CA exist that aren’t matched by stereotypes about other Western states
	- Californians participate in sounds change: fronting of (uw) and (ow) (=GOOSE and GOAT)

Attendance: familiarity of (a) grip (of) meaning 'a lot of'
