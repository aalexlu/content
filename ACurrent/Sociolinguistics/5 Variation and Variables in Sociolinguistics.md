## Transcribing sounds
**Orthography:** standardized writing system with rules for spelling, punctuation, and capitalization
- cannot use English orthography to classify sounds in phonetics. ex: fish

## Articulation of sounds
- Consonants: produced with some obstruction in the vocal tract
- Vowels: height (tongue), backness (tongue body), rounding (lips), tenseness
	- **monophthong**: simple ("pure") vowel, only one vowel sound
	- **diphthong**: sequence of two vowel sounds, more than one target
	- vowel formants: concentrations of frequency (f1, f2, f3 can be seen in Praat)
		- higher f2, more front
- Transcribed examples
	- [pʰæst], [pʰɪtʃ], [bal], [fit]

## Variables
**Variable:** A linguistic feature that varies: it can surface, or be realized, as two more more variants
- variants should be essentially "the same"
- variables referred to using parenthesis (bath, mad, pass)

Abstract representation vs. surface forms
- /n/ -> [n̪] / _ θ
- **phoneme** is the abstract representation; it surfaces as a particular **phone** in a particular conttext
	- deterministic: whenever a rule can apply, it will 100% of the time
**Free variation:** when we haven't yet determined the constraints; still might exist
- constrants can be linguistic or non-ling
	- non-ling constraints can be social or cognitive

## From dialectology to sociolinguistic variation
- David Britain's study of the Fens
	- Used to be swamp, barrier to movement -> as swamps drained, less variation overall
	- Reallocation (reanalysis) of the regional distinction to be a phonological one (PRICE)
- Labov's Martha's Vineyard study
