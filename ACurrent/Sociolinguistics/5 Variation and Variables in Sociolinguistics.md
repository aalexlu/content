## Transcribing sounds
**Orthography:** standardized writing system with rules for spelling, punctuation, and capitalization
- cannot use English orthography to classify sounds in phonetics. ex: fish

#### Discussion Section
*February 1, 2023*
Transcription practice
1. Book [bʊk]
2. Cat [kæt]
3. Linguistics [liŋgwɪstɪks]
4. tree [tɹi]
5. trend [tɹɛnd]
6. move [muv]
7. icy [aɪsi] 
8. say [seɪ]
9. said [sɛd]
10. though [ðow]
11. august [ɑgəst]
12. cringe [ k]
13. love [ləv]

## Articulation of sounds
- Consonants: produced with some obstruction in the vocal tract
- Vowels: height (tongue), backness (tongue body), rounding (lips), tenseness
	- **monophthong**: simple ("pure") vowel, only one vowel sound
	- **diphthong**: sequence of two vowel sounds, more than one target
	- vowel formants: concentrations of frequency (f1, f2, f3 can be seen in Praat)
		- higher f2, more front
- Transcribed examples
	- [pʰæst], [pʰɪtʃ], [bal], [fit]

## Variables
**Variable:** A linguistic feature that varies: it can surface, or be realized, as two more more variants
- variants should be essentially "the same"
- variables referred to using parenthesis (bath, mad, pass)

Abstract representation vs. surface forms
- /n/ -> [n̪] / _ θ
- **phoneme** is the abstract representation; it surfaces as a particular **phone** in a particular conttext
	- deterministic: whenever a rule can apply, it will 100% of the time
**Free variation:** when we haven't yet determined the constraints; still might exist
- constrants can be linguistic or non-ling
	- non-ling constraints can be social or cognitive

## From dialectology to sociolinguistic variation
#### David Britain's study of the Fens
- Used to be swamp, barrier to movement -> as swamps drained, less variation overall
- Reallocation (reanalysis) of the regional distinction to be a phonological one (PRICE)

#### Labov's Martha's Vineyard study
- Studied PRICE (ay) and MOUTH (aw) vowels
- **Interspeaker variation**: Not all speakers used the local variant
- **Intraspeaker variation**: Not all speakers who use the local variant always use it
- The **envelope of variation**: All, and only, the contexts in which a variable occurs; ignore contexts in which *only* one variant can occur, or where the variants mean different things
	- For (ay), the eov is all words containing a low vowel onset with a front offglide
- Conclusion
	- Linguistic factors explain most of the variation: (ay) followed by voiceless fricatives or stops (/t, s, p, f/) were likelier to favor the centralized variant ([əi]); Following sonorants (/l, r, n, m/) favored the lower variant ([ai])
	- non-ling factors also relevant
**The Labovian Revolution**:
1. Record what people say, not what they *say* they say
2. Test for correlations between linguistic behavior and social factors; *locally relevant* factors
3. Language change can be studied while it's still happening; synchronic variation (happening now) often leads to diachronic variation (language change over time)

## Awareness of specific linguistic features
- **Stereotype**: a feature widely recognized, often the subject of commentary, impersonation, performance (accurate or not)
	- Canadian “eh?”, Valley girl “like”, Singapore “lah”, creaky voice
- **Marker**: a variable that speakers are less aware of, but which shows consistent style effects
	- “Style effects” (we’ll discuss this in more depth) includes how formal or casual a speaker is being, and that will involve an increase or decrease of a variant
- **Indicator**: a variable that speakers are not aware of, which does not display style shifting; it may distinguish groups/communities, though

## Motivations for variation / change
- A desire to show how you fit in with some people and are diff from others
- A desire to do things that have value in the community
- A desire not to do things that are looked down on in the communituy
- A desire to work out how others are orienting themselves to the concerns above
