## How are ethnic varieties acquired?
- Ethnic varieties are learned
- Socilaization often takes place within ethnic groups, rather than across them
	- cluster in **enclaves**, schools, places of worship
	- **endogamy** (marrying within the group) often valued
- Patterns can also emerge by *divergence* from ethnically-marked variety of parents
	- Labov 2001: 2nd-gen Italians and Jews in NY â€“ raising values instead of lowering like their parents

#### Naming ethnic varieties
- Debates about how to name ethnic lang varieities relate to debates about how to refer to ethnic groups **ethnonyms**
- Biases are sometimes reflected in the names for linguistic features too

## Chicanx English
- **Chicanx English**: native variety of English spoken by descendants of Spanish speakers from Mexico
- Vowel inventory:  map more closely onto Spanish
- Consonants: affricate /tf/ and fricative /shuah/ merged or interchanged
- Phonotactics (rules of phoneme sequences): word-final consonant cluster reduction, often /t/ 
- Variant [in] for (ing)
- Negative concord
- Lexical differences

## Jewish English
- Native variety of Jews living in English-speaking countries
- borrows from both Hebrew and Yiddish
- Some Jewish English lexical items borrowed from Yiddish
- Frequent final /t/ release
- *Discussion*: style shifting vs code switching????
	- code switching for switching between different languages rather than variable features associated with social factors, such as gender or speech context


#### Problems with "ethnolect"
- *shul* Orthodox Jews use more than Non-orthodox synagogue
- People vary from context to context, but also over the course of their lifetime as their identity evolves
- "Ethnolects" are soemtimes used with non-group members
- **Crossing**: White Britons adopting Punjabi words, Young white American hip-hop fans adopting AAE
	- people have strong opinions that you should not do this crossing
- Ethnicity is a fluid category, people can have multiple and index multiple at once

#### Ethnolinguistic repertoire
- **Ethnolinguistic repertoire**: a fluid set of linguistic resources that members of an ethnic group may use variably as they index their ethnic identities
- Speakers agentively use features to align (or not) with others, and to express who they are
