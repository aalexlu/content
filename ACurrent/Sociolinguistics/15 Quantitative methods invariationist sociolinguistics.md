## Variationist sociolinguistics
- We study the *variable grammar* of speech communities and individual community members
- **Variable**: a feature that varies in form from one context to another
	- must define explicitly and unambiguously to quantify
	- *variable* is abstract, *variants* are concrete surface forms

#### Notation for variables
- IPA symbols in parentheses: (i)
	- different from underlying form in phonology /i/ and from surface forms [i]
- Well's standard lexical sets: FLEECE
- Modified IPA symbols, in slashes

#### Variables
- Two or maore ways of "saying the same thing"
	- Easy to say that "coffee" and "cawfee" are variants
- Sociophonetics much more rich than sociosyntax.. etc

#### The variable context
- The **envelope of variation** = variable context
	- Rate of variant A = (# tokens of A) / (# tokens of A + # tokens of B)

Analyzing "randomness" in linguistic data
- lopoking for **orderly heterogeneity** in language

## Discussion Section
*March 8, 2023

#### Sociolinguistic methods
- Dialect surveys/maps
- Sociolinguistic interview
	- ask them authentic/enthusiastic questions
- Rapid and anonymous surveys
	- Labov department store
	- not subject to observer's paradox
	- Disadvantage: Assumptions about who you're interviewing that may not be accurate / est. age

#### Research project
Track age / gender / familiarity
2 weeks, get 120 tokens in this timeframe
Can make it clear I am making assumptions

Rapid anonymous
- won't be able to track detailed info
- depends on factors

#### NC (r) example
(r) r-fulness and r-lessness
post-vocalic (r) not at start of syllable like 'very'
age / geographic location / gender
USE () for variable notation
- varies so not /r/ which is underlying form
- neutral way to frame phonetic variable

Old woman urban Speaker 1: 8/9 r-less
Young woman urban Speaker 2: 0/10 r-less
Old man non-urban Speaker 3: 2/5 (together better)
Young man non-urban Speaker 4: 3/6
