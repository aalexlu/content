#### Sociolinguistic methods
- Dialect surveys/maps
- Sociolinguistic interview
	- ask them authentic/enthusiastic questions
- Rapid and anonymous surveys
	- Labov department store
	- not subject to observer's paradox
	- Disadvantage: Assumptions about who you're interviewing that may not be accurate / est. age

#### Research project
Track age / gender / familiarity
2 weeks, get 120 tokens in this timeframe
Can make it clear I am making assumptions

Rapid anonymous
- won't be able to track detailed info
- depends on factors

#### NC (r) example
(r) r-fulness and r-lessness
post-vocalic (r) not at start of syllable like 'very'
age / geographic location / gender
USE () for variable notation
- varies so not /r/ which is underlying form
- neutral way to frame phonetic variable

Old woman urban Speaker 1: 8/9 r-less
Young woman urban Speaker 2: 0/10 r-less
Old man non-urban Speaker 3: 2/5 (together better)
Young man non-urban Speaker 4: 3/6
