## Peircean semiotics
- Ferdinand de Saussure: A *sign* is the link between a concept (the "signified") and a sound pattern (the "signifier")
- Charles Sanders Peirce: *semiosis* (the making of meaning through signs) involves three parts
	- Signs
	- Objects
	- Interpretants
		- "Tree" is a sign pointing to an actual tree; the interpretant is the effect or outcome between the relationship between sign and object
		- ex: a feeling of appreciation of beauty
#### Peircean signs
- **Icon**: a sign that refers to its object by mrans of sinilarity (photographs, sketches, diagrams); sound symbols (choo choo train)
- **Index**: a sign that refers to its object due to its connection with the individual object and with the senses or memory of the person for whom it serves as a sign
	- Smoke: indexes fire
	- Clock: indexes time and its passage
	- Pronouns (they, me), deictics (now, there)
- **Symbol**: a sign that refers to its object due to a convention or habit
	- We call certain furry pets "dogs" simply by convention

Is a *hot dog* a sandwich?

## Indexicality
- The notion of the *indexical sign* has been very influential in linguistic anthropology
- How, where, and why linguistic forms *point* to social or cultural context
	- **Referential indexicality**: Pronouns point to actors; deictics point to places and times; and their meaning shifts
	- **Non-referential indexicality**: Linguistic forms can also *point* to other apsects of social and cultural context
		- Regional dialects, ethnic ways of speaking, linguistic gender performance, etc.
		- Generic language: “once upon a time...”
- In what ways can *vocabulary* be indexical of social or cultural context?
	- ex: TA vs GSI, they do or do not go to berkeley
	- ex: slay vs groovy vs cool vs let's gooo
- In what ways can *language choice* be indexical of social or cultural context?
	- ex: info not meant to be widely consumed
	- ex: I am ready to have solidarity with you
Examples
- A high school student mimics the voice of a character on a sitcom
	- Both people watch the show; understand it together
- A politician labels somebody an “enemy combatant” or a “terrorist”
	- Index their political views on some conflict
- Bilingual children code-switch in the presence of a monolingual child
	- Index you're not in our group/exclusion, or inclusion if switching into the monolingual language

#### Orders of Indexicality
- First-order indexicality: e.g., a Southern accent indexes having grown up in the South
- Second-order indexicality: e.g., a Southern accent indexes being lazy  
	- layer on top of each other

- First-order: Japanese sentence-final particle wa used to affirm a feeling
- Second-order: Japanese sentence-final particle wa is feminine

- Language ideology lives at the intersection of orders of indexicality

The social meaning of variation
- The social meaning of variables/variants isn't fixed or precise; there may often exist a field or a constellation of ideologically related meanings
	- *Indexical field*
- Centralization of (ay) on Martha's Vineyard
	- Associated with traditional industries (fishing), an affinity towards the island community
	- Its “social meaning” or social significance: Local authenticity
- Over time, the social meaning of variables has (implicitly) been understood to derive from more abstract demographic categories: sex, ethnicity, social class

Sex and gender
- Sociolinguists have long been interested in the correlates between language use and sex
	- Speaker sex has been thought of in binary biological/physiological terms (M / F)
	- Influenced by theory in other disciplines, we often think now of the relationship between language use and gender (social identity constructed/performed through social actions)
- Gender is encoded in languages, to varying degrees
	- Eynikl 'grandchild' in Yiddish is neutral, but English speakers can specify gender
	- Kuzin/kuzine 'cousin' in Yiddish are gender-specific, but Engllish cousin is not
		- *Grandson* and gendered pronouns like he are a **direct index** of gender; the semantic representation has a [+male] feature


Indexing
- In addition to direct indexing, there is indirect indexing, which is more common

Men and women speaking different languages?

Preferential gender differences
- Linguistic features that are *exclusively* used by (or to refer to) one sex are rare
	- **Preferential features** are more common (used more by speakers of a particular gender)
	- Preferential features are constitutive of gender
- Language features are indexical of gender
	- They can be associated with speech acts, stances, and particular discourse activities, which are seen as associated with a particular gender
	- These kinds of associations can make particular linguistic features “gendered”

#### The "gendering" of linguistic forms
- Ochs: Japanese sentence-final particles that show the speaker's attitude towards the proposition of a sentence
	- *Ze* is considered "male" while *wa* is considered "female"; actually the association is probabilistic
		- *Ze* is assertive so more men use
- Tag questions in English ("…isn't it?")
	- Tags that are supportive (vs. challenging) occur more in the speech of women
- Sex-exclusive forms in Lakota?
	- Sentence-final particles indicating **illocutionary force**: making a statement, making an order, asking a question

#### Intervening variables
- A correlation with a particular social category may mask some other attribute that is also associated with that category
	- E.g., power
- Differences in men’s and women’s social networks and jobs

#### Performance of gender
- An individual’s gender is something exercised: a speaker can conform to the social expectations associated with gender, or reject them, or other
- **Gender performance**: gender doesn’t exist outside of the context of performed actions and ways of talking, which are defined by society as “gendered” in a particular way

Local definitions of gender

Variation and sexuality
- One’s *gender* can intersect with one’s identification with other categories, like local identity, and have an effect on sociolinguistic variation
- Same goes for *sexuality*
	- Heath, a gay medical student
	- longer stop release burst when talking to friends vs when talking to patients

## Recap
- The field of (variationist) sociolinguistics has developed from considering the impact of speaker sex, aggregated over many speakers, to the impact of gender, in localized, individualized interactions

### Discussion Question 5

What information included in VanHerk Chapter 7 (Gender) did you find most interesting, compelling, or surprising? Why? 

Some questions that you might consider to get you started: Do you think one theory is better than another for connecting language and the social practice of gender? Did you find that any of the research findings referenced in the chapter did not match your hypotheses? Do you have any questions about research on gender and language in sociolinguistics following your reading of this chapter?

I found the fact that women use standard variants more often than men interesting. Trudgill, Key, and Eckert argue that women use style shifting to position themselves with respect to social groups, while men use other ways aside from language to mark their social status such as jobs. Whether women are shifting toward or away from the standard, I thought it was interesting how the argument holds.

On a similar note, Deborah Tannen's perspective was also compelling. She found that women are more likely to use language to build and maintain relationships, while men are more likely to use language to communicate factual information. This parallels the idea of how "language is what women use to do things, socially."
