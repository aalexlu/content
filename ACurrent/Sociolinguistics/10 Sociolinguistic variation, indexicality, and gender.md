## Peircean semiotics
- Ferdinand de Saussure: A *sign* is the link between a concept (the "signified") and a sound pattern (the "signifier")
- Charles Sanders Peirce: *semiosis* (the making of meaning through signs) involves three parts
	- Signs
	- Objects
	- Interpretants
		- "Tree" is a sign pointing to an actual tree; the interpretant is the effect or outcome between the relationship between sign and object
		- ex: a feeling of appreciation of beauty
#### Peircean signs
- **Icon**: a sign that refers to its object by mrans of sinilarity (photographs, sketches, diagrams); sound symbols (choo choo train)
- **Index**: a sign that refers to its object due to its connection with the individual object and with the senses or memory of the person for whom it serves as a sign
	- Smoke: indexes fire
	- Clock: indexes time and its passage
	- Pronouns (they, me), deictics (now, there)
- **Symbol**: a sign that refers to its object due to a convention or habit
	- We call certain furry pets "dogs" simply by convention

Is a *hot dog* a sandwich?

## Indexicality
- The notion of the *indexical sign* has been very influential in linguistic anthropology
- How, where, and why linguistic forms *point* to social or cultural context
	- **Referential indexicality**: Pronouns point to actors; deictics point to places and times; and their meaning shifts
	- **Non-referential indexicality**: Linguistic forms can also *point* to other apsects of social and cultural context
		- Regional dialects, ethnic ways of speaking, linguistic gender performance, etc.
		- Generic language: “once upon a time...”
- In what ways can *vocabulary* be indexical of social or cultural context?
	- ex: TA vs GSI, they do or do not go to berkeley
	- ex: slay vs groovy vs cool vs let's gooo
- In what ways can *language choice* be indexical of social or cultural context?
	- ex: info not meant to be widely consumed
	- ex: I am ready to have solidarity with you
Examples
- A high school student mimics the voice of a character on a sitcom
	- Both people watch the show; understand it together
- A politician labels somebody an “enemy combatant” or a “terrorist”
	- Index 
- Bilingual children code-switch in the presence of a monolingual child
