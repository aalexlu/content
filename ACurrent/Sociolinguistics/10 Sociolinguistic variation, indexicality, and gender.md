## Peircean semiotics
- Ferdinand de Saussure: A *sign* is the link between a concept (the "signified") and a sound pattern (the "signifier")
- Charles Sanders Peirce: *semiosis* (the making of meaning through signs) involves three parts
	- Signs
	- Objects
	- Interpretants
		- "Tree" is a sign pointing to an actual tree; the interpretant is the effect or outcome between the relationship between sign and object
		- ex: a feeling of appreciation of beauty
#### Peircean signs
- **Icon**: a sign that refers to its object by mrans of sinilarity (photographs, sketches, diagrams); sound symbols (choo choo train)
- **Index**: a sign that refers to its object due to its connection with the individual object and with the senses or memory of the person for whom it serves as a sign
	- Smoke: indexes fire
	- Clock: indexes time and its passage
	- Pronouns (they, me), deictics (now, there)
- **Symbol**: a sign that refers to its object due to a convention or habit
	- We call certain furry pets "dogs" simply by convention

Is a *hot dog* a sandwich?

## Indexicality
- The notion of the *indexical sign* has been very influential in linguistic anthropology
- How, where, and why linguistic forms *point* to social or cultural context
	- **Referential indexicality**: Pronouns point to actors; deictics point to places and times; and their meaning shifts
	- **Non-referential indexicality**: Linguistic forms can also *point* to other apsects of social and cultural context
		- Regional dialects, ethnic ways of speaking, linguistic gender performance, etc.
		- Generic language: “once upon a time...”
- In what ways can *vocabulary* be indexical of social or cultural context?
	- ex: TA vs GSI, they do or do not go to berkeley
	- ex: slay vs groovy vs cool vs let's gooo
- In what ways can *language choice* be indexical of social or cultural context?
	- ex: info not meant to be widely consumed
	- ex: I am ready to have solidarity with you
Examples
- A high school student mimics the voice of a character on a sitcom
	- Both people watch the show; understand it together
- A politician labels somebody an “enemy combatant” or a “terrorist”
	- Index their political views on some conflict
- Bilingual children code-switch in the presence of a monolingual child
	- Index you're not in our group/exclusion, or inclusion if switching into the monolingual language

#### Orders of Indexicality
- First-order indexicality: e.g., a Southern accent indexes having grown up in the South
- Second-order indexicality: e.g., a Southern accent indexes being lazy  
	- layer on top of each other

- First-order: Japanese sentence-final particle wa used to affirm a feeling
- Second-order: Japanese sentence-final particle wa is feminine

- Language ideology lives at the intersection of orders of indexicality

The social meaning of variation
- The social meaning of variables/variants isn't fixed or precise; there may often exist a field or a constellation of ideologically related meanings
	- *Indexical field*
- Centralization of (ay) on Martha's Vineyard
	- Associated with traditional industries (fishing), an affinity towards the island community
	- Its “social meaning” or social significance: Local authenticity
- Over time, the social meaning of variables has (implicitly) been understood to derive from more abstract demographic categories: sex, ethnicity, social class

Sex and gender
- Sociolinguists have long been interested in the correlates between language use and sex
	- Speaker sex has been thought of in binary biological/physiological terms (M / F)
	- Influenced by theory in other disciplines, we often think now of the relationship between language use and gender (social identity constructed/performed through social actions)
- Gender is encoded in languages, to varying degrees
	- Eynikl 'grandchild' in Yiddish is neutral, but English speakers can specify gender
	- Kuzin/kuzine 'cousin' in Yiddish are gender-specific, but Engllish cousin is not
		- *Grandson* and gendered pronouns like he are a **direct index** of gender; the semantic representation has a [+male] feature


Indexing
- In addition to direct indexing, there is indirect indexing, which is more common

Men and women speaking different languages?

Preferential gender differences
- Linguistic features that are *exclusively* used by (or to refer to) one sex are rare
	- **Preferential features** are more common (used more by speakers of a particular gender)
	- Preferential features are constitutive of gender
- Language features are indexical of gender
	- They can be associated with speech acts, stances, and particular discourse activities, which are seen as associated with a particular gender
	- These kinds of associations can make particular linguistic features “gendered”

#### The "gendering" of linguistic forms
- Ochs: Japanese sentence-final particles that show the speaker's attitude towards the proposition of a sentence
	- *Ze* is considered "male" while *wa* is considered "female"; actually the association is probabilistic
		- *Ze* is assertive so more men use
- Tag questions in English ("…isn't it?")
	- Tags that are supportive (vs. challenging) occur more in the speech of women
