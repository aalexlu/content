## Lifespan change
#### Ruth Bader Ginsburg (RBG)
- Longitudinal studies take forever
	- But celebrities have recordings spanning decades
- How she sounded in 1975 (as a lawyer) vs. 2010 (as a justice)
	- variables: THOUGHT /ɔ/ or /ɑ/ (height) and postvocalic /r/
	- 2010 more high and no postvocalic /r/
- Moved from NYC to Washington in 1980, yet latest data (2011-2012) shows increase in NYC features
	- THOUGHT vowel shows a binary effect: lawyer years vs. justice years
		- F1 is inversely related to vowel height
	- (r) also shows increased NYC-ness
	- (r-lessness) over time, but with a weaker overall correlation
	- doesn't need to perform the same way as a justice; can relax her speech into NYC
	- 

#### David Attenborough
- Do speakers who are exposed to variation also show variation over time, in the direction of a community shift?
- Narrator of many nature documentaries; born in London educated at Cambridge
- In England, there's a loss of the tap [ɾ] as a variant of /r/
- Comparison of his pre-recorded narration in 1950's; this is all *read* speech
	- Two types of intervocalic /r/
		- *word-internal* (ve**r**y, fo**r**est) and *linking* (fa**r** away, ou**r** engines)
- Findings
	- He stilll taps; no significant change in tapping over time
	- Word-internally; he is stable int apping rate
	- Linking, Attenborough *increases* his tapping in frequent two-word collocations
		- **Retrograde change**: a shift to greater use of conservative variant
		- Conclusion: these have become more word-like over time

## Change in progress
- We know that people vary in the way that they speak, but sometimes the variation is stable in the community
- When is it appropriate to say definitively that a language is changing?
#### Guy et al. 1986
- Intonation is notoriously difficult to study historically, but it can be studied now with recorded speech
- Hypothesis: there is a change in progress in Australian English with the use of a *high rising terminal* countour, aka **"uptalk,"** aka **Australian Questioning Intonation (AQI)** in declarative sentences
- **AQI**: the use of “questioning intonation” in non-questioning contexts
	- Rather than question the proposition (the information), the speaker is questioning whether they are being understood (a “metapropositional” question, while making declarative statements)
	- A request for verification; how do we know this though? – responded to be (mhm, eye contact, nods)
	-
