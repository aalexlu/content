## Language Change
- All historical linguists, and many sociolinguists, study language change
- There is an important connection between **synchronic variation** (variation in any given moment) and **diachronic variation** (variation over time, i.e., language change)
	- Synchronic variation doesn’t always lead to diachronic variation
	- but diachronic variation always comes from synchronic variation

Themes:
- How do sociolinguists study language change?
- How do sociolinguists thing about *time*?
	- What are the available methods? pros and cons? assumptions behind those methods?

Real time vs. apparent time
- **Real time**: studying language use in year X, X + 50, X = 100, etc.
	- generally better, more reliable; much harder to obtain!
	- **real time study** compares speech at two points in time
		- can use a **corpus** (corpora), a collection of speech or text, to study language change in real time (ex: unique NZ mashup of 3 corpora)
	- Types – of real time (or longitudinal) studies
		1. **Panel study**: a real-time study using the very same speakers interviewed multiple times of some period of time
		2. **Trend study**: a real-time study using similar speakers (demographically similar; from the same community) recorded at different points in time
- **Apparent time**: studying language in a single moment, but comparing people of different ages as a proxy of how the language has been changing
	- Relies on important assumptions about how speakers behave over their lifetimes
	- A way to model/simulate real time changes using *synchronic* data
	- Much more common in sociolinguistics than real time studyies; single person/team can feasibly collect all the interview data, over a relatively short period of time
	- A construct of sociolinguistics, because it relies on the  
assumption that apparent time is analogous to real time
