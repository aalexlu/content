## Language Change
- All historical linguists, and many sociolinguists, study language change
- There is an important connection between **synchronic variation** (variation in any given moment) and **diachronic variation** (variation over time, i.e., language change)
	- Synchronic variation doesn’t always lead to diachronic variation
	- but diachronic variation always comes from synchronic variation

Themes:
- How do sociolinguists study language change?
- How do sociolinguists thing about *time*?
	- What are the available methods? pros and cons? assumptions behind those methods?

#### Real time vs. apparent time
**Real time**: studying language use in year X, X + 50, X = 100, etc.
- generally better, more reliable; much harder to obtain!
- **real time study** compares speech at two points in time
	- can use a **corpus** (corpora), a collection of speech or text, to study language change in real time (ex: unique NZ mashup of 3 corpora)
- Types – of real time (or longitudinal) studies
	1. **Panel study**: a real-time study using the very same speakers interviewed multiple times of some period of time
	2. **Trend study**: a real-time study using similar speakers (demographically similar; from the same community) recorded at different points in time
Panel studies
- Most famous “panel study” in the media (data can still be mined!) is the Up series on British TV
	- teaches us Phonology is more stable than lexicon; we acquire new words all the time
- Most famous panel study in sociolinguistics is on Montreal French
	- Community shift away from alveolar trill [r] to the uvular trill [ʀ]
	- Montreal French had uvular variant 37% in 1971; 49% in 1984; 62% in 1995
	- Blondeau and her colleagues found that they are fairly stable, lending evidence to the apparent time construct
	- But there are some outliers...
		- 18 of 25 Montreal French speakers don’t change significantly in their use of /r/

**Apparent time**: studying language in a single moment, but comparing people of different ages as a proxy of how the language has been changing
- Relies on important assumptions about how speakers behave over their lifetimes
- A way to model/simulate real time changes using *synchronic* data
- Much more common in sociolinguistics than real time studies; single person/team can feasibly collect all the interview data, over a relatively short period of time
- **Apparent time construct**: A *construct* of sociolinguistics, because it relies on the assumption that apparent time is *analogous* to real time (all a theory/hypothesis based on assumption)
	- Apparent time can only be a proxy for real time if we assume the **critical period** of language acquisition
		- We acquire our native language(s) over a period of time (childhood until early teens), which has an endpoint
		- After this endpoint our language is relatively fixed and stable
	- The speech of a 75-year-old thus reflects the speech that would have been acquired about 70-ish years ago; this is a *snapshot* of a historical period of time in the community’s language
		- If younger people are behaving differently it’s because the community’s language has undergone change
- Example of apparent time inferences:
	- Western Ontario has, as a speech community, changed from using "chesterfield" to using "couch"
	- /aɪ/-monophthongization in Texas English
		- Evidence of a change in progress?
	- Support for Apparent time
		- Guy Bailey
		- Younger generations going back to using old forms
	- Puerto Rican Spanish
		- Canonical verbs 'Maria said' used more nny older people
- Testing the apparent time construct
	- Labov’s research on Martha’s Vineyard found that young people who had positive associations with the island had higher rates of centralization (saying [nəɪt] rather than [naɪt] for night); maybe a change in progress?
		- This was an apparent time result that couldn’t be compared directly to dialect surveys, since those didn’t consider the relative frequency of different pronunciations
		- The best way to test the apparent time construct is with real time data

#### Profiles of change
- Generational change: the change when generations increasingly use an innovative variant (typically shown in apparent time studies)
	- The montreal study of /r/ also showed **lifespan change**: change to a speaker's speech patterns after the critical period
		- Known to be minimal for phonological variables though the lexicon is famously subject to such changing
	- **Age-grading**: Another form of individual variation; when speakers (as a whole) favor one variant at some point in their life and another variant at another point
		- Sometimes speakers increase then decrease their use of some variant; this may *look* like a community shift in the synchronic dimension, but it's actually *not* a case of language change in the community
		- **Stable variation**: there are multiple variants, but no evidence that one is "taking over" the other in time
			- (ing): the stigmatized alveolar variant is remarkably resilient, and exists alongside the standard variant [ɪn], [ɪŋ]
			- "Th-stopping”: saying ting for thing or dis for this in many varieties of English; also stable
		- Age-grading often gives rise to *stable variants* (though not all stable variants are examples of age-grading)
		- **Linguistic marketplace**: certain linguistic forms are assigned symbolic value because of their association with middle class (who also ensure it retains that value)
			- Standard variants tend to peak in 20s, when speaking standardly affords people better jobs or better success in jobs
			- Retreat in middle age because they don't feel the pressure of the linguistic market as much, maybe not job hunting or retiring

Discussion Section Question 4
In what ways is your speech different from your parents' speech (or that of other older people you know)? Are there particular features that you associate with "sounding older"?

My parents speak with a Chinese American accent, and often mix up gender pronouns, so in that sense, my speech is different from my parents'. Otherwise, I associate people who speak slowly and use more compound sentence structures as sounding older. 


Can you think of any ways that your language has changed over your lifespan? For example, are there ways of speaking or features that you have picked up since starting college?

One way of speaking since I've started college is using less vocal fry. I actually began to notice it in my speech after Ling100 Freshman year and began doing it less by default after. Also, I now use less "um"'s in everyday speech compared to when I was younger.
