## Language Change
- All historical linguists, and many sociolinguists, study language change
- There is an important connection between **synchronic variation** (variation in any given moment) and **diachronic variation** (variation over time, i.e., language change)
	- Synchronic variation doesn’t always lead to diachronic variation
	- but diachronic variation always comes from synchronic variation

Themes:
- How do sociolinguists study language change?
- How do sociolinguists thing about *time*?
	- What are the available methods? pros and cons? assumptions behind those methods?

#### Real time vs. apparent time
- **Real time**: studying language use in year X, X + 50, X = 100, etc.
	- generally better, more reliable; much harder to obtain!
	- **real time study** compares speech at two points in time
		- can use a **corpus** (corpora), a collection of speech or text, to study language change in real time (ex: unique NZ mashup of 3 corpora)
	- Types – of real time (or longitudinal) studies
		1. **Panel study**: a real-time study using the very same speakers interviewed multiple times of some period of time
		2. **Trend study**: a real-time study using similar speakers (demographically similar; from the same community) recorded at different points in time

- **Apparent time**: studying language in a single moment, but comparing people of different ages as a proxy of how the language has been changing
	- Relies on important assumptions about how speakers behave over their lifetimes
	- A way to model/simulate real time changes using *synchronic* data
	- Much more common in sociolinguistics than real time studyies; single person/team can feasibly collect all the interview data, over a relatively short period of time
	- **Apparent time construct**: A *construct* of sociolinguistics, because it relies on the assumption that apparent time is *analogous* to real time (all a theory/hypothesis based on assumption)
		- Apparent time can only be a proxy for real time if we assume the **critical period** of language acquisition
			- We acquire our native language(s) over a period of time (childhood until early teens), which has an endpoint
			- After this endpoint our language is relatively fixed and stable
		- The speech of a 75-year-old thus reflects the speech that would have been acquired about 70-ish years ago; this is a *snapshot* of a historical period of time in the community’s language
			- If younger people are behaving differently it’s because the community’s language has undergone change
	- Example of apparent time inferences:
		- Western Ontario has, as a speech community, changed from using "chesterfield" to using "couch"
		- /aɪ/-monophthongization in Texas English
			- Evidence of a change in progress?
		- Support for Apparent time
			- Guy Bailey
			- Younger generations going back to using old forms
		- Puerto Rican Spanish
			- Canonical verbs 'Maria said' used more nny older people
	- Testing the apparent time construct
		- Labov’s research on Martha’s Vineyard found that young people who had positive associations with the island had higher rates of centralization (saying [nəɪt] rather than [naɪt] for night); maybe a change in progress?
			- This was an apparent time result that couldn’t be compared directly to dialect surveys, since those didn’t consider the relative frequency of different pronunciations
			- The best way to test the apparent time construct is with real time data
