## Language Change
- All historical linguists, and many sociolinguists, study language change
- There is an important connection between **synchronic variation** (variation in any given moment) and **diachronic variation** (variation over time, i.e., language change)
	- Synchronic variation doesn’t always lead to diachronic variation
	- but diachronic variation always comes from synchronic variation

Themes:
- How do sociolinguists study language change?
- How do sociolinguists thing about *time*?
	- What are the available methods? pros and cons of those methods?  
■ What are the assumptions behind those methods?
