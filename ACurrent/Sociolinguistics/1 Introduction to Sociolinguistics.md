## What is Sociolinguistics?

## Chomsky
competence: somebody who has learned the grammar and can form sentences and judge grammaticality
vs
performance: what people actually do / say

## Sociolinguistics
Formal linguistic vs Sociolinguistic perspective
- Formal linguistics interested in general linguistic competence
	- perform elicitations – translation exercises and proposing minimal pairs
- Sociolinguistic competence: allows us to use language appropriately depending on the context of the interaction

**What is sociolinguistics?**
- The study of language in society; how it reflects social patterns, how it contributes to them
	- Traditionally, interest in the “grammar” of the speech community as a whole (which is inherently variable)
	- Traditionally, interest in the vernacular, which is where genuine language patterns are to be found
- How people use language to build relationships, to construct or perform their identity (gender, ethnicity, group membership, individual style, etc.)

## Broad questions
- Who uses different forms or language varieties? Who do they use them  with? Are they aware of their choice?
- Why do some forms or languages ‘win out’ over others? (And is it always the same ones?)
- What kind of social information do we ascribe to different forms in a language or different language varieties?
- How much can we change or control the language we use?
