## Labov’s department store study
- The social stratification of (r) in New York City deparment stores
- The "classic methodological problem: the means used to gather the data interfere with the data to be gathered"
	- **observer's paradox**
	- Mitigation strategies: (i) group interviews; (ii) observation of language without any interview
	- Rapid and anonymous survey to study the sociolinguistic structure of the speech community
- Research question: is (r) a social differentiator in all levels of New York City speech?
	- And: can rapid and anonymous speech events be used as the basis for a systematic study of language?
	- YES
- Hypothesis: if any two subgroups of NYC speakers are ranked in a scale of social stratification, then they will be ranked in the same order by their differential use of (r) – **social stratification**
	- **Social stratification**: the normal workings of society have produced systematic differences between certain institutions or people, and these differentiated forms have been ranked in status or prestige by general agreement
	- Hypothesis for (r): salespeople in highest-ranked store should have highest values for (r); intermediate for middle-ranked stores; lowest for lowest-ranked stores
- Study: the salespeople of three large Manhattan department stores
	- Top, middle, and bottom of price and fashion scale
	- salesgirls borrow prestige from customers or make an effort in the direction – "lending" prestige
- Methodology: Customer (Labov) approached salespeople and asked for directions to a  particular department known to be on the fourth floor; then asked again  with an “excuse me?” to get another token of the phrase, spoken more  carefully and emphatically
	- fourth floor: preconsonantal and final position, in both casual and emphatic style
	- (r-1) = r-ful pronunciation; (r-0) = r-less pronunciation; doubtful cases / partial constriction not in final stats

Department stores
- Price/advertising differences:
- Spaciousness of physical layout
- Social stratification does not carry forward neatly to wages
- *Important*: Employees of the three stores would get roughly the same socioeconomic index, but the working conditions are stratified along the general status scale: Saks > Macy’s > S. Klein

#### Ethics of Labov's study
- Like scraping tweets
- Anonymous and not recorded

#### Stratification of (r)
- Saks most r-ful and less of a 4th/floor shift
- floor (end of word) is more often r-1 (r-ful) than fourth
	- this is a pattern mainly for Sak's and Macy's

#### Discussion: Rapid and anonymous survey
- Fine levels of stratification? YES even with people in the same social group he could find differentiations
- Consistent from interview to interview
- Lexical variable of Old building names vs New names (building) (KROEBER)
- Name of Cal / UC Berkeley / UCB

## Discussion Section
*March 1, 2023

#### Research project
1. Collect original speech data
2. Identify variants in data
3. Analyze patterns based on social factors
4. Write a report explaining methods and results

#### Language and social class
- Standard: form that is assumed to be inherently "correct"
- Unmarked: form that is assumed to be the "default" or "normal"
	- Phonology OT – markedness constraints
Mismatch in standardness and markedness?
- Unmarked in NY community, but not standard for all of US
- "whom" vs "who", in speech not everyone uses "whom" correctly
	- "whom" is standard but marked/less normal

#### Case study: reflexive pronouns
1. ungrammatical
2. weird
3. I, ok
4. a
5. referred to themselves earlier, ok (Only grammatical one)
6. weird
7. ok
*Only should be used as an object with the same original pronoun to index; coreferentiality*

Crossover effect
- overusing something to the point of hyper-correct
- try hard to meet a standard and go beyond it
- Second socioeconomic (SEC) class actually uses the standard more than the top SEC
	- lower middle class emulates what they would think upper middle class does

#### Change over time: negative concord in English (double neg)
- Highly stigmatized in standard English varieties
- Common / grammatical in many languages
	- French "Je n'ai rien mangé"
- Used to be common in English

Gentry (high) used it the least, non-gentry continued using it
Middle ranks end up using it less than gentry

Race and gender also are involved, so can't completely separate from SEC
