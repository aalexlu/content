### Comparing Models
- Speech community
	- Labov
	- Share the same variety and social conventions
	- Defined by shared sociolinguistic norms
- Social network
	- Each person has multiple networks that change over time
	- Networks are connected through shared members
- Community of practice (CoP) slide 16
	- Group defined by mutual engagement, jointly negotiated enterprise, shared repertoire
	- Assumes conscious effort of speakers to maintain linguistic identities

Examples
- Undergraduate students at Cal – *Speech community comprised of many social networks*
- A group of linguists studying the syntax of Garifuna in a field methods class – *CoP, narrowly defined group*
- Members of a Discord server for a CS class – *Social network*
- SLuGs – *Social network, core members, periphery members*
- Newscasters who speak in a formal news-reading style – *None of the groups, even though they speak the same way*
- Speakers of southern US English who are non-rhotic – *Speech community*
