## "Style shifting"
- Labov: NYers paying attention to speech more self-conscious and deliberately more r-ful as it's more standard

Example of accommodation to addressee
- Miriam Meyerhoff: research in Vanuatu (national language is Bislama)
- Null subjects in Bislama (rather than pronouns)
	- *The captain* told everyone to stay quiet. *He* waited until *he* thought it was safe.
	- The captain told everyone to stay quiet.  _ Waited until _ thought it was safe.
- Omitted pronouns/null pronouns more often with family, used overt pronouns with MM
	- accommodating to the person he's talking to

Style as "attention to *others*"
- Giles: If a speaker invites a researcher into their home, they're already *accomodating*. Could *accommodate* linguistically too
- Casual vs interview speech (Attention to one's speech or to one's addressee)
- Reading tasks (Attention to the task/genre of reading aloud)
- How can we operationalize Giles’s insight from social psychology in a way that can be studied by linguists?

#### Audience design
- Allan Bell: audience design
- The idea that *intraspeaker variation* arises because speakers are paying attention to who they are addressing or who might be listening to or overhearing them
- "Design": the speaker is exercising some agency
- “Audience”: the motivator for tailoring one’s language
- Studied intervocalic /t/ in New Zealand radio stations
	- dependent variable: producing intervocalic /t/ as a [t] or [r] flap (better, city)
	- Independent variable: pop (general, inc working class) vs. classical music station (higher socio-econ class)
	- More conservative [t] variant on classical station, more innovative [ɾ] (flap) variant on pop station
- *Audience design* makes a strong claim that style shifting (a type of *intraspeaker variation*) derives from differences associated with different audiences (a perception of *interspeaker variation*)
	- Individuals can pick up on, and make use of, interspeaker variation within their own (intraspeaker) speech
	- We might also predict that an individual speaker’s variation will be less extreme than interspeaker variation, since the former comes from the latter

"Audience" versus "addressee"
- **addressee** = the person we're directly addressing
- other potential listeners: **auditors** (active listener), **overhearers** (known), **eavesdroppers** (unknown)
	- Influence: addressee > auditor > overhearer > eavesdropper
- Examples
	1. A teacher scolding a student for teasing his or her classmate (student addressee, other student auditor, everyone else overhearer or auditor)
2. Two friends gossiping at a campus cafe (friend addressee, overhearers, eavesdroppers)
3. A politician answering a moderator’s question at a debate  
4. A politician practicing a campaign speech with staff members (maybe direct auditors which are campaign staff, real audience later)

#### Discussion
1. How can we account for the style stratification of (r) in Labov's NYC study in the framework of audience design?
	- For the casual style, the addressee was often someone who was not the interviewer
	- 
2. Does audience design explanation "buy us anything" over the *attention to speeech* explanation for (r) stratification?
3. Are there other variables that, if they are involved in style shifting, would more clearly illustrate *audience design* than *attention to speech*?
	- slang associated with your generation
	- bilingualism, not necessarily attention

#### The Foxy Boston study
- most serious test of Bell's *audience design* paradigm
- Foxy Boston, an African-American teenager interviewed over several years
	- Beth, a white interviewer, and Faye, a black interviewer
	- If audience design holds straightforwardly, we’d expect Foxy Boston to use fewer AAE variants with Beth and more AAE variants with Faye
	- AAE (BE absent, Subject agreement absent – *She crazy. She think you don't care.*)
- Findings (*-s* absence, by verb type and interview)
	- Foxy Boston's raw range of variation was less than the two "extremes" of AAVE and WAVE
	- Counter Bell, Foxy Boston showed more topic-based shifting than audience-based shifting
		- more overt standard when talking about school, than about hookup culture
	- Confounds...
		- Maybe attunement based on **familiarity** rather than race of addressee (attention to speech could still be at play)
			- Familiarity: Foxy and Faye knew each other for some time; Foxy and Beth met for first time at interview
			- Beth's interview transcript half as short
#### Audience design
- Predictions are not always easily testable due to sheer amount of non-lingistic information (context) that could be relevant to any social interaction
	- Presence of people nearby, specific interpersonal relations
- Some of the challenges posed by our definition of "style" will also come up when we need to define and operationalize other social categories (age, class, ethnicity, gender)

#### Responsive vs. initiative
- When speakers tweak the way they speak according to their audience, contex, topic, it is *responsive*
	- A *reaction* to a given
