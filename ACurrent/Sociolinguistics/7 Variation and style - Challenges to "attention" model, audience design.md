## "Style shifting"
- Labov: NYers paying attention to speech more self-conscious and deliberately more r-ful as it's more standard

Example of accommodation to addressee
- Miriam Meyerhoff: research in Vanuatu (national language is Bislama)
- Null subjects in Bislama (rather than pronouns)
	- *The captain* told everyone to stay quiet. *He* waited until *he* thought it was safe.
	- The captain told everyone to stay quiet.  _ Waited until _ thought it was safe.
- Omitted pronouns/null pronouns more often with family, used overt pronouns with MM
