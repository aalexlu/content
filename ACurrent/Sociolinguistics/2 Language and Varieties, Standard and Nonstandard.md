## Language vs Dialect

"A language is a dialect with an army and a navy."
- meant to reflect the precarious status of Yiddish, compared to German

Terminology
- Language: "X-ish," a named variety spoken by the X people/ethnic group in X-land
- Dialect: Applied tow hat are generally considered sub-carieties of a single language (e.g., Egyptian, Tunisian, Yemeni, … Arabic)
- Accent: Phonological component of a dialect (how people sound, without respect to grammatical differences)
- Variety: A neutral term to refer to languages and dialects; avoids the terminological controversy of 'language' vs. 'dialect' and the associations associated with them(~"lect")
	- not the same as *variation, variable, variant*
	- Variable: /t/-deletion -> [t], ø (West side, East end)
- Jargon
- Sociolect, ethnolect

## Reading: "Linguistic Facts of Life"

All linguists agree on the following:
- All spoken languages change over time
- All spoken languages are equal in terms of linguistic potential
- Grammaticality and communicative effectiveness are distinct and independent issues
- Written language and spoken language are historically, structurally, and functionally fundamentally different
- Variation is intrinsic to all spoken language at every level, and much of that variation serves an emblematic purpose

## All spoken languages change

Change affects all levels of the linguistic system:
- Sounds (phonetics, phonology), the structure of words (morphology, lexicon), the way sentences are put together (syntax), and meaning (semantics)
- The only languages that don’t change are moribund/dead languages
- Corollary: language change cannot be stopped unless the language dies/is killed off
- Standardization tries to curb language change, and succeeds to some degree

Old English -> Middle English -> Shakespeare

## All spoken languages are equal for expression
- All languages are capable of being used for similar expressive purposes
- Vocabulary size ≠ expressive capacity
- Morphological richness ≠ communicative efficiency
- Speakers will compensate for “gaps” in certain areas using other strategies

## Standard language
- Standard Language Ideology (SLI) sometimes imposes restrictions that are unnatural and require careful maneuvering
- Singular *they*: stands in for a person whose gender is not known or not important often w/ indefinite or quantifier antecedents
