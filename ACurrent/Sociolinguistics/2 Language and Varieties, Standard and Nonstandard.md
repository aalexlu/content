## Language vs Dialect
"A language is a dialect with an army and a navy."
- meant to reflect the precarious status of Yiddish, compared to German

## Terminology
- Language: "X-ish," a named variety spoken by the X people/ethnic group in X-land
- Dialect: Applied tow hat are generally considered sub-carieties of a single language (e.g., Egyptian, Tunisian, Yemeni, … Arabic)
- Accent: Phonological component of a dialect (how people sound, without respect to grammatical differences)
- Variety: A neutral term to refer to languages and dialects; avoids the terminological controversy of 'language' vs. 'dialect' and the associations associated with them(~"lect")
	- not the same as *variation, variable, variant*
	- Variable: /t/-deletion -> [t], ø (Wes side, East end)
- Jargon
- Sociolect, ethnolect

## Reading: "Linguistic Facts of Life"
All linguists agree on the following:
- All spoken languages change over time
- All spoken languages are equal in terms of linguistic potential
- Grammaticality and communicative effectiveness are distinct and independent issues
- Written language and spoken language are historically, structurally, and functionally fundamentally different
- Variation is intrinsic to all spoken language at every level, and much of that variation serves an emblematic purpose

## All spoken languages change
Change affects all levels of the linguistic system:
- Sounds (phonetics, phonology), the structure of words (morphology, lexicon), the way sentences are put together (syntax), and meaning (semantics)
- The only languages that don’t change are moribund/dead languages
- Corollary: language change cannot be stopped unless the language dies/is killed off
- Standardization tries to curb language change, and succeeds to some degree

Old English -> Middle English -> Shakespeare

## All spoken languages are equal for expression
- All languages are capable of being used for similar expressive purposes
- Vocabulary size ≠ expressive capacity
- Morphological richness ≠ communicative efficiency
- Speakers will compensate for “gaps” in certain areas using other strategies

## Spoken language ≠ written language  
- Widespread literacy and the advent of cheap printing necessitated written standards
- Most salient difference between spoken language and written norms is conformity, or the suppression of variation
- Linguists are generally more interested in speech than in writing, but this interest is not matched by lay people
- “Punctuation is irrelevant to the kind of work sociolinguists do, and has nothing to do with grammaticality” (Lippi-Green 2012)
	- Really?
	- Twitter studies: word-lengthening (wordddd) and ;) vs ;-)

## Variation is intrinsic to all spoken language
- Variation occurs naturally from utterance to utterance; usually isn't random
- Three main sources:
	- Language-internal pressures, e.g., due to production or perception phenomena (dive -> dove or dived)
	- Language-external pressures: e.g., social pressures to speak a certain way when pursuing higher education or moving to a new area
	- Variation due to language being a creative vehicle of expression

## Standard language
- Standard Language Ideology (SLI) sometimes imposes restrictions that are unnatural and require careful maneuvering
- Singular *they*: stands in for a person whose gender is not known or not important often w/ indefinite or quantifier antecedents
	- "Anyone who cares about their children should be concerned about good nutrition."
	- "…tell a woman what they can or can't do with their own bodies."
- Singular *they* with known referents (e.g., gender non-binary) is a newer development; met with a ton of resistance from, among others, purists who care about “grammar”
	- "John and Sue went out for pasta. John loved his spaghetti, but Sue hated their fettucini."
## Why does SLI persist?
- "circle of intimidation"

## "Grammar"
Linguists: The rules that govern language structures (syntax and beyond), which children acquire in their early years  
Non-linguists: The prescriptive norms that govern sentence structure but also style and even punctuation  

- Linguistic grammaticality: like the laws of physics
	- Can’t be violated (e.g., extraction of phrases from coordinate structures)
- Socially constructed grammaticality: like the laws of a government
	- Can be violated and often is (e.g., preposition stranding in English)  

**When we are evaluating/judging a speaker’s language, often we are actually evaluating the speaker.**

## Standard language myths – Pinker
- on the American Heritage Dictionary usage panel
The standard language myth holds that…
- There is a correct English (or X-ish) that speakers are constantly subverting
	- Speakers who just happen to hold less power... (often stigmatized groups)
- The language needs to be protected from its speakers
	- Without any standard, chaos ensues
- **Non**standard language = **sub**standard language
	- Well, if it weren’t substandard, why would we bother to correct it?
	- Well, if it’s the language of the under-educated, why wouldn’t it be substandard?
