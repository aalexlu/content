## Generalizations about speaker sex and variation
- Early studies linking variation to language change wanted to identify *diagnostics* of change in real time
- Criticisms of research on variation and speaker sex
	- downplays speakers' agency
	- suggests that a biological category like sex might determine the way people talk and behave
- Today
	- Generalizations fromm early, large community studies
	- Studies about gender identity and sociolx from trans speakers

#### Speaker sex: Generalizations
- **Principle 1**: In cases of stable variation, women use the standard variant more than men do
	- Examples
		- (ing) variable: [ɪŋ] women > men
		- (dh) variable: [θ], [ð] women > men
		- negative concord: ‘I didn’t do anything’ women > men
	- Stable variation: Why?
		- Hypothesis: Women are more sensitive to the standard
		- Trudgill: Men are more often evaluated on what they do, women on the impression they make
		- Eckert: Women make more use of symbolic resources (in speech, clothing, make-up) to establish their position in, and identification with, a social group; or their opposition to a group
- **Principle 1a (Change involving standards)**: When there is language change towards greater use of a standard variant, women generally lead over men
	- Women use the more positively evaluated variant more than men do
	- (r): higher socioeconomic classes are more r-ful than lower classes (overt prestige); younger people are more r-ful than older speakers (change); and women are found to innovate more than men
	- Other correlates: economics: Ucieda (N. Spain): rural dialect raises final /o/ to [u]; younger < older, women < men
- **Principle 2 (Women and Change)**: When there’s a change in progress “from below” (the level of awareness; little to no style-shifting), women often use more of the incoming variant than men do
	- Laxing of /i/ and /u/ (to [ɪ] and [ʊ]) before /l/ (steel->still, pool->pull) in Utah and Texas; younger women > younger men
	- Eckert’s work on a Detroit high school: backing of /ʌ/ (bus->boss) as part of the Northern Cities Shift
- **Good generalizations**
	- Women/girls lead change from above and change from below, vs. men/boys
	- If we find this kind of sex stratification in a new study, then we might consider this a *diagnostic* of language change

Iraqi Arabic
- Women more likely to be excluded from the education to know classical features

The 'Gender Paradox'
- Women use more standard forms and more vernacular forms
- One idea: women's speech reflects the community's target
- Eckert: maybe the paradox is a consequence of our binning
	- maybe different women being standard vs. innovative

The "social meaning" of sex/gender-correlated change
- Women often lead change over men, in the aggregate
- Variables occur as components of styles, and to understand their meaning, we need to understand their role in the construction of styles

Ways of defining style
- Attention to speech; casual to careful (variation in the cognitive realm)
- Different ways of signaling who we are as speakers; different ways of being, and different identities (variation in the social realm)
- Stylistic practice is a process of *bricolage*
	- Speakers can identify and attribute significance to linguistic features, and they become a resource that they can incorporate into their own style

#### Belten High (Detroit)
- Eckert studied white adolescent speech in Detroit suburbs
- school-oriented "jocks" and urban-oriented "burnouts"

#### The social meaning of variation
- Speakers use variables not simply to reflect their belonging to social group, but to make ideological moves
- Diversity of social meanings, ex: educated, formal, effortful, articulate/pretentious, social types: British, Nerd girl, Gay diva

## Gender and bricolage
- **Bricolage**: two features not patterning together
- transmasculine voices, fundamental frequency, and /s/
	- Transgender speakers ine arly stages of hormone therapy
- F0 and time of recording: F0 drops later into hormone therapy
- Center of gravity of /s/: maybe F0 is more of a target goal to be perceived as masculine than frequency of /s/; 
	- having low F0 (more masc sounding) allows them to exercise more freedom in other features 
- Gender is not unidimensional, but constructed through the use of a cluster of different resources

#### Linguistic Differentiation
- **Linguistic differentiation**: the labeling of a way of speaking as different from, or opposed to, some other way of speaking.
- Three processes:
	- **Iconization**: a linguistic feature appears to be similar in some way to individuals or to whole groups
	- **Fractal recursivity**: when an opposition or contrast operating at one level is projected onto another level
	- **Erasure**: language ideologies can render certain linguistic features, activities, or speakers invisible
