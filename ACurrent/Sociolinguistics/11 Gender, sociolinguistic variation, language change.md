## Generalizations about speaker sex and variation
- Early studies linking variation to language change wanted to identify *diagnostics* of change in real time
- Criticisms of research on variation and speaker sex
	- downplays speakers' agency
	- suggests that a biological category like sex might determine the way people talk and behave
- Today
	- Generalizations fromm early, large community studies
	- Studies about gender identity and sociolx from trans speakers

#### Speaker sex: Generalizations
- **Principle 1**: In cases of stable variation, women use the standard variant more than men do
	- Examples
		- (ing) variable: [ɪŋ] women > men
		- (dh) variable: [θ], [ð] women > men
		- negative concord: ‘I didn’t do anything’ women > men
	- Stable variation: Why?
		- Hypothesis: Women are more sensitive to the standard
		- Trudgill: Men are more often evaluated on what they do, women on the impression they make
		- Eckert: Women make more use of symbolic resources (in speech, clothing, make-up) to establish their position in, and identification with, a social group; or their opposition to a group
- **Principle 1a (Change involving standards)**: When there is language change towards greater use of a standard variant, women generally lead over men
	- Women use the more positively evaluated variant more than men do
	- (r): higher socioeconomic classes are more r-ful than lower classes (overt prestige); younger people are more r-ful than older speakers (change); and women are found to innovate more than men
	- Other correlates: economics: Ucieda (N. Spain): rural dialect raises final /o/ to [u]; younger < older, women < men
- **Principle 2 (Women and Change)**: When there’s a change in progress “from below” (the level of awareness; little to no style-shifting), women often use more of the incoming variant than men do
	- Laxing of /i/ and /u/ (to [ɪ] and [ʊ]) before /l/ (steel->still, pool->pull) in Utah and Texas; younger women > younger men
	- Eckert’s work on a Detroit high school: backing of /ʌ/ (bus->boss) as part of the Northern Cities Shift
- **Good generalizations**
	- Women/girls lead change from above and change from below, vs. men/boys
	- If we find this kind of sex stratification in a new study, then we might consider this a *diagnostic* of language change

Iraqi Arabic
- Women more likely to be excluded from the education to know classical features

The 'Gender Paradox'
- Women use more standard forms and more vernacular forms
- One idea: women's speech reflects the community's target
- Eckert: maybe the paradox is a consequence of our binning
	- maybe different women being standard vs. innovative

The "social meaning" of sex/gender-correlated change
- Women often lead change over men, in the aggregate
