previous: [[5 Variation and Variables in Sociolinguistics]]

## Recap

#### Envelope of variation ex 1:
- **Variable**: wanna contraction (*I want to read. ~ I wanna read*)
- **Hypothesis**: "whenever the word *want* is followed by the preposition *to*, it can be contracted as wanna"
- Counter-examples:
	- What do you want to see?
	- Who do you want to eat?
	- Who do you want to speak?
#### Envelope of variation ex 2:
- **Variable**: dative alternation (*I gave Bob a book. ~ I gave a book to Bob*)
- **Hypothesis**: verbs with two objects can appear with a double object structure (V NP NP) or with a prepositional structure (V NP to/for NP)
- focus on *give, make, send, award, elect, vote, call, show*
	- * I gave Bob the creeps. I gave the creeps to Bob. (headache, chills)
	- I make Bob a pie. I make a pie for Bob.
	- * I voted Clinton for president.
	- * I call Bob my friend. I call my friend to Bob.
	- I called John a cab. I called a cab for John.

## Variation and style

Attendance: Speaking style more affected by self-conscious you are about the way you're speaking or the people you're speaking with?

#### Labov's Study of New York City English
- NYCE is a dialect pocket: differs from surrounding areas in perceptible and sometimes stereotyped ways
	- **R-less**: where [ɹ] is not pronounced unless it precedes a vowel
		- *car, port, garden, surprise*; not *radio, Carol*
		- Sometimes called deletion of coda /r/ or postvocalic /r/
		- NYers show considerable **intra-speaker** variation, which Labov hypothesized varies by style
- Random sampling
- Sociolinguistic interview
	1. Chat with the interviewee about their background, life experiences, some beliefs/opinions
	2. read aloud a short narrative (carefully constructed to contain target variables in as many ling environments as possible)
	3. Read a list of words in isolation (some of which contain the target variables and some do not)
	4. Read a list of minimal pairs (pairs of words that differ from eachother in only one sound)
	- Parts of the interview were meant to get at different styles, defined by Labov as a function of how much **attention** a speaker is paying to their own **speech**.
- Style
	- from *formal* to *informal*
		- minimal pair list
		- word list
		- reading passage
		- interview speech
	- **Hypothesis**: r-less in informal/casual styles, r-ful in formal styles
	- **Stratification**: the systematic and consistent patterning of a variant with respect to some independent factor
	- Style across different topics: religious or opinion
	- Style shifting: (-ing) -> [ɪn], [ɪŋ]
		- stratification both by social class and style; upper-middle class more secure therefore less shifting
- T/D deletion (e.g. *wes* for *west*)
	- The View more casual than DNC (democratic national convention)
- NYC (Lower East Side) as a speech community
	- Shared norms (style shifting patterns) is suggestive of treating the LES as a speech community

#### Sociolinguistic prestige
- **Overt prestige**: the prestige associated with a variant that people are highly aware of and which is associated more with the speech of higher-status speakers
	- being r-ful in BYC ("better" or "nicer")
- **Covert prestige**: the prestige associated with a variant when speakers’ positive evaluation of that variant is covert or hidden
	- "local prestige" – indicative of socially desirable qualities
	- Often involved when there is a mismatch between people's self-reported usage vs actual usage

#### Observer's paradox
- The double-blind researchers find themselves in when what they are interested in knowing is how people behave when they are not being observed; but the only way to find out how they behave is to observe them
	- Observation may affect what we are observing
- Can be used to researchers' advantage
- Mitigation strategies
	- **Participant observation**: the practice of spending longer periods of time with speakers observing how they use language, react to others’ use of it, and how language interacts with and is embedded in other social practices and ideologies.
	- Wiretap, secretely observe
	- Pre-existing audio recordings: do not know they are being observed by linguists

Discussion question 3: How do overt and covert prestige relate to style effects?
Overt prestige is associated with the speech of higher-status speakers and is typically associated with the dominant social group. In relation to style effects, in situations requiring more formality, speakers may be more likely to use the language variety associated with overt prestige. On the other hand, covert prestige is associated with a variant when speakers’ positive evaluation of that variant is covert or hidden; this may be more apparent in informal conversations. Both types of prestige play a role in shaping style effects, as speakers will choose to speak differently depending on the context.
