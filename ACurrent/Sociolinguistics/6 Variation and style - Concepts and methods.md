## Recap

Envelope of variation example 1:
- Variable: wanna contraction (*I want to read. ~ I wanna read*)
- Hypothesis: "whenever the word *want* is followed by the preposition *to*, it can be contracted as wanna"
- Counter-examples:
	- What do you want to see?
	- Who do you want to eat?
	- Who do you want to speak?
Envelope of variation ex 2:
- Variable: dative alternation (*I gave Bob a book. ~ I gave a book to Bob*)
- Hypothesis: verbs with two objects can appear with a double object structure (V NP NP) or with a prepositional structure (V NP to/for NP)
- focus on *give, make, send, award, elect, vote, call, show*
	- I gave Bob the creeps. I gave the creeps to Bob.
	- I make Bob a pie. I make a pie for Bob.
	- * I voted Clinton for president.
	- * I call Bob my friend. I call my friend to Bob.
	- I called John a cab. I called a cab for John.
