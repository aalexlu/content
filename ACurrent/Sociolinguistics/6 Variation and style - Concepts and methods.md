previous: [[5 Variation and Variables in Sociolinguistics]]

## Recap

#### Envelope of variation ex 1:
- **Variable**: wanna contraction (*I want to read. ~ I wanna read*)
- **Hypothesis**: "whenever the word *want* is followed by the preposition *to*, it can be contracted as wanna"
- Counter-examples:
	- What do you want to see?
	- Who do you want to eat?
	- Who do you want to speak?
#### Envelope of variation ex 2:
- **Variable**: dative alternation (*I gave Bob a book. ~ I gave a book to Bob*)
- **Hypothesis**: verbs with two objects can appear with a double object structure (V NP NP) or with a prepositional structure (V NP to/for NP)
- focus on *give, make, send, award, elect, vote, call, show*
	- * I gave Bob the creeps. I gave the creeps to Bob. (headache, chills)
	- I make Bob a pie. I make a pie for Bob.
	- * I voted Clinton for president.
	- * I call Bob my friend. I call my friend to Bob.
	- I called John a cab. I called a cab for John.

## Variation and style

Attendance: Speaking style more affected by self-conscious you are about the way you're speaking or the people you're speaking with?

#### Labov's Study of New York City English
- NYCE is a dialect pocket: differs from surrounding areas in perceptible and sometimes stereotyped ways
	- **R-less**: where [É¹] is not pronounced unless it precedes a vowel
		- *car, port, garden, surprise*; not *radio, Carol*
		- Sometimes called deletion of coda /r/ or postvocalic /r/
		- NYers show considerable **intra-speaker** variation, which Labov hypothesized varies by style
- Random sampling
- Sociolinguistic interview
	1. Chat with the interviewee about their background, life experiences, some beliefs/opinions
	2. read aloud a short narrative (carefully constructed to contain target variables in as many ling environments as possible)
	3. Read a list of words in isolation (some of which contain the target variables and some do not)
	4. Read a list of minimal pairs (pairs of words that differ from eachother in only one sound)
	- Parts of the interview were meant to get at different styles, defined by Labov as a function of how much **attention** a speaker is paying to their own **speech**.
- Style
	- from *formal* to *informal*
		- minimal pair list
		- word list
		- reading passage
		- interview speech
	- **Hypothesis**: r-less in informal/casual styles, r-ful in formal styles
	- **Stratification**: the systematic and consistent patterning of a variant with respect to some independent factor
	- Style across different topics: religious or opinion
