### Discussion Question 6

What is the relationship between standards and markedness? Is this relationship different with respect to language vs. with respect to other behaviors? (hint: start with page 57 of the VanHerk chapter)

Markedness refers to the degree to which a linguistic feature deviates from what is considered to be the norm in a language or speech community. Therefore, the standard variety in particular, gains its power from its apparent unmarkedness.

When speakers of a mainstream variety adopt the language features of a marked ethnic variety, this behavior can be highly marked, as this switching is less frequent because of the power relationships between the varieties. The behavior of when people who speak non-standard varieties is unmarked, as they are somewhat expected to pick up the language of power.
