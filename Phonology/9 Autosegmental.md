# Autosegmental Theory

two theoretical tiers; phonological processes can affect either tier

- **melodic tier:** where the articulatory and featural information goes *(feature matrices, IPA symbols)*
- **timing tier:** slots which indicate lengths of time for each type of segment
  - sometimes agnostic as to what kind of sound we're dealing with (in which case X is used)
  - sometimes specified for consonant (C) or vowel (V)

A timing slot always tries to link to something on the melodic tier
