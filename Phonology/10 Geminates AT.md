# Autosegmental Phonology: Geminates

## Tier Segregation

Assuming same tier

1. Occam's razor
2. Geminate integrity

Obligatory Contour Principle (OCP): adjacent identical elements prohibited

## When to Segregate

each morpheme begins the derivation on its own distinct tier

OCP not universally respected

- Syncope: high vowels elide between identical consonants
- Raising: raising in two-sided open syllable environment

## Geminate and Singleton Inalterability

rules that otherwise apply to singleton segments systematically fail to apply to geminates

geminates more predisposed to inalterability effects than singletons, but both types of segments show inalterability effects
