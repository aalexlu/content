# Syllable Weight and Syllabification

Syllable weight in Latin and Egyptian Arabic

- light - CV (non-branching rhymes)
- heavy - CVV, CVC (branching rhymes)

## Terminology

Additions

1. **Epenthesis:** the insertion of a segment into a word	⟵
2. **Prothesis:** the addition of a segment to the <u>beginning</u> of a word
3. **Paragoge:** the addition of a segment to the <u>end</u> of a word
4. Sometimes epenthesis of a vowel is called **anaptyxis** or **svarabhakti**

Subtractions

1. **Syncope:** the loss of a segment (most commonly applied to vowel loss)	⟵
2. **Aphaeresis:** the loss of a segment from the <u>beginning</u> of a word
3. **Apocope:** the loss of a segment from the <u>end</u> of a word	⟵

## Again

Implicational universals

1. Onset Maximization: tendency that syllables must have onsets
2. Codas: tendency that syllables are open
   - CVC ⟶ fix to CV (consonant apocope) or CVCV (vowel epenthesis)
   - OT ex: Boumaa Fijian

|           | Max (no deletion) | No Coda | Dep (no insertion) |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| tʃon      |                   | *       |                    |
| **tʃone** |                   |         | *                  |
| tʃo       | *                 |         |                    |

*Max and No Coda interchangeable so dotted line between*

## Syllabification Algorithms

General rules of syllabification

1. Project a syllable <u>nucleus</u> from local sonority peaks (in most languages, each vowel)
2. Adjoin the consonant immediately to the left of the nucleus as an <u>onset</u>

All languages have (1) and (2); others continue…

3. Keep adjoining onset consonants leftward as far as sonority restrictions or language-specific phonotactic patterns will allow
4. Everything left over is a <u>coda</u>

### Direction of Epenthesis in Arabic Dialects

- Epenthesis in Cairene: ∅ → i / CC __ C
  - scanning L → R
  - → VC~1~C~2~ ↑ C~3~
  - [ʔult**i**lu]
- Epenthesis in Iraqi: ∅ → i / C __ CC
  - scanning R → L
  - VC~1~ ↑ C~2~C~3~ 
  - [gil**i**tla]
