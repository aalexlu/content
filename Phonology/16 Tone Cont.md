# Tone Continued

## 1 Association Conventions

Common association conventions

- Associate tones with V slots, 1-to-1, left-to-right
- "Spread" the rightmost tone to any leftover V slots
- Link any leftover tones to the rightmost V slot (forming a *contour*)

**Tone is *autosegmental*:** not limited to being a feature in th feature matrix describing a segment.

- same tone can describe several segments simultaneously

**Obligatory Contour Principle (OCP):** adjacent identical elements on a melodic tier are prohibited

## 2 Tone Polarity

Dissimilarity to the preceding tone

**Tone is *autosegmental*:** a multiply associated tone can act as a unit

## 3 Downtrend

1. **Downdrift** (catathesis)
   - the process whereby a L tone lowers the register (pitch range) in which following H tones are realized
   - ex: if HLH, second H is lower than first H since it is preceded by L
2. **Downstep**
   - the phenomenon whereby a tone known to be H is realized lower than a preceding H
   - ex: H !H
3. **Declination**
   - the process whereby the F0 contour is gradually lowered over the course of the utterance
   - ex: downdrift present, but at the end, even with only HHHH, tone becomes lower
