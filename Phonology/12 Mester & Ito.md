# Japanese Mimetic Palatization

Underspecification

- **naive**
- **radical:** mantains that all predictable features, both redundant and unmarked, are left unspecified, thereby resulting in minimiation of specification in underlying structure
- **restricted:** mantains that only redundant features are underspecified, thereby positing a fundamental phonological distinction between features which function contrastively and those which do not

**mimetic palatalization:** an element of uncontrolledness to the base

- japanese: palatalize the rightmost coronal
- do not palatilize /r/ (f, g)
- if no palatalizable coronal, palatalize (d, g)

example of conflicting directionality in autosegmental association (rightmost, else leftmost)

mimetic morpheme ("Ï€" = [+high, -back]) is responsible for palatalization
