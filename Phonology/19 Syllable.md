# Syllable

**Syllables (σ):** the structural units which provide melodic organization to strings of segments

- **onset (O):** the consonant which precedes the vowel
- **nucleus (N):** the vowel of the core syllable
- **coda (C):** the consonant which follows the vowel

Onset Maximization: possible consonants are syllabified as syllable onsets

Types: ON, ONC, NC, N

## Syllable-Internal Structure

σ →{ onset, rhyme { nucleus, coda } }

## Sonority

**The sonority hierarchy:** a putatively-universal ranking of segment types in order of their intrinsic sonority

- vowels > glides > liquids > nasals > fricatives > stops

**The Sonority Sequencing Principle (SSP):** Between any member of a syllable and the syllable peak, a sonority rise or plateau must occur. Syllables can be seen as local sonority peaks with accompanying rises and falls on either side.
