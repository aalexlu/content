# Tone

*w8*

## Contrastive Pitch

pitch: phonetic manifestation of tone - purely physical

Can be

- **lexical:** part of a word's underlying form
- **grammatical:** functioning like an affix

Tone is marked on the **tonal tier:** slots for tones (H, L); links to melodic tier units

### Intonations

- Declarative intonation: (Q: *Who brought that present?* A:) Marissa. (L<u>H</u>L)
- Vocative intonation: (*calling loudly*) MARISSSSAAA! (L<u>H</u>M)
- Interrogative intonation: Marissa?? (L<u>M</u>H)
- Surprised intonation: Marissa!? (H<u>L</u>H)

## Tone-Bearing Units (TBU)

TBU: *in autosegmental phonology* any element on the segmental (melodic usually) tier which is capable of bearing a tone

- most often a syllabic nucleus

## Tone Stability

tone stability: the deletion of a vowel does not result in the deletion of the tone *borne by* the vowel

- ex: èk**é ò**kpá → èk**ô**kpá
- ó = H	ò = L	ô = HL (falling)	ǒ = LH (rising)

well-formedness condition: all vowels must *bear* some tone, and all tones must be *borne by* some vowel

## Tone Association

tone melodies: left-to-right association and spreading

- if underlying tones < TBUs: last tone to get assigned will spread to all remaining TBUs
- if underlying tones > TBUs: sometimes multiple tones link to same TBU

## Tone Polarity
