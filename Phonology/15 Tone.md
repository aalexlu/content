## Tone-Bearing Units (TBU)

TBU: *in autosegmental phonology* any element on the segmental tier which is capable of bearing a tone

- most often a syllabic nucleus

## Tone Stability

tone stability: the deletion of a vowel does not result in the deletion of the tone *borne by* the vowel

- ó = H	ò = L	ô = HL	ǒ = LH

well-formedness condition: all vowels must *bear* some tone, and all tones must be *borne by* some vowel

## Tone Association

tone melodies: left-to-right association and spreading
